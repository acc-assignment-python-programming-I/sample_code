    "# Chapter 10: Classes and Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary:\n",
    "Chapter 10 in \"Starting Out with Python\" focuses on the concepts of classes and object-oriented programming (OOP). Here are the key points covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming**:\n",
    "   - **Procedural Programming**: Involves writing procedures or functions that operate on data.\n",
    "   - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Focuses on creating objects that contain both data (attributes) and procedures (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Object-Oriented Programming Concepts**:\n",
    "   - **Objects**: Entities containing data and methods. Data is known as attributes, and procedures are known as methods.\n",
    "   - **Encapsulation**: Combining data and code into a single object.\n",
    "   - **Data Hiding**: Restricting access to an objectâ€™s data attributes to prevent accidental corruption.\n",
    "   - **Object Reusability**: Objects can be reused across different programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classes**:\n",
    "   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects.\n",
    "   - **Instance**: An object created from a class.\n",
    "   - Class definitions include methods and data attributes. Methods typically include an initializer method `__init__` which is executed when an instance is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Working with Instances**:\n",
    "   - Instances have attributes that belong specifically to them.\n",
    "   - Accessor methods retrieve values from attributes without changing them, while mutator methods modify attribute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Passing Objects as Arguments**:\n",
    "   - Objects can be passed as arguments to methods and functions, which then operate on these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Techniques for Designing Classes**:\n",
    "   - **UML Diagrams**: Graphically depict object-oriented systems.\n",
    "   - **Identifying Classes**: Involves finding nouns in problem descriptions that could represent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Summary of Key Concepts**:\n",
    "   - Differences between procedural and object-oriented programming.\n",
    "   - Class and instance definitions, the `self` parameter, and methods like `__init__` and `__str__`.\n",
    "   - Techniques for designing and identifying classes in a problem domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Code: Creating and Using a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a sample Python code demonstrating the creation and use of a class, including accessor and mutator methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a class named BankAccount\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    # Initializer method\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance=0.0):\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Method to deposit money\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount > 0:\n",
    "            self.__balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Method to withdraw money\n",
    "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:\n",
    "            self.__balance -= amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Accessor method to get the balance\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance\n",
    "\n",
    "    # __str__ method to display the object's state\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"BankAccount(balance={self.__balance})\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating instances of the BankAccount class\n",
    "account1 = BankAccount()\n",
    "account2 = BankAccount(100.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Performing operations on the accounts\n",
    "account1.deposit(50.0)\n",
    "account2.withdraw(20.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Displaying the balance of each account\n",
    "print(\"Account 1 balance:\", account1.get_balance())\n",
    "print(\"Account 2 balance:\", account2.get_balance())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the __str__ method\n",
    "print(account1)\n",
    "print(account2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code defines a `BankAccount` class with methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance, as well as an initializer and a `__str__` method to display the account details. Two instances of the class are created, and various operations are performed on them."
